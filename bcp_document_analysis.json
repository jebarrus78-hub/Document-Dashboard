                "Most users are setup to work remotely. Transition Workload Working from home may not be feasible in all situations. If CX CMS is unable to operate at normal productivity levels by working at home, then the BFT/Event Duty Manager may decide to offload work to the shift before and the shift after the affected site. To get that help, the Command Center Duty Manager works with the Local Site Contacts, and the BFT Managers to allocate the workload to non-impacted sites. • Identify dependencies on potential site • Identify additional workload on potential site • Coordinate transition with appropriate teams and management Relocate Personnel to Alternate Site If a CX CMS site is unavailable for an extended period, the BFT will decide alternatives, such as temporarily working in another building or moving to a different site until the original site is accessible again. The Site Manager will communicate the instructions and timing of moving to a different building or site location once that location becomes available. • Identify Site • Coordinate Relocation Requirements • Inform Employees of Site Move and Schedule"

This is a limited workaround as labs must be physically accessed to perform certain tasks in service requests. Support Services can engage other sites to assist and/or assume ownership of such tasks/service requests. If resources are damaged (e.g. equipment, laptop), the manager closest to the information on what is needed will be tasked with replacement. For example, the site director may need to coordinate replacement of laptops, phones, etc. were affected by an event at a site. Most L1 TCE’s (GDP/Partner) do not have CVO (Cisco Virtual Office) or a company provided laptop. BFT/CXC CPR will contact the Support Services L1 Vendor Managers for options such as VPN. Support Services engineers can normally work from home by connecting to VPN (AnyConnect) or CVO (Cisco Virtual Office setup) to work service requests. However, working from home may not be feasible in all situations & if Support Services is unable to operate at normal productivity levels by working at home, then the BFT/CXC CPR may decide to offload Service Requests to other available teams/theaters. In that event, the BFT/CXC CPR will work with Routing Ops to change case routing to other theatres for technology queues, and in some situations, it may be necessary to assign existing Service Requests to those other Support Services sites. GDP/Partner Vendors, Managers and other necessary teams may be utilized as well. The Support Services Technology Team Manager (not the CPR/DM) continues to be responsible for assigning existing Service Requests to other Support Services sites. They will Identify dependencies on potential site, identify additional workload on potential site and help coordinate transition with appropriate teams and management. Additionally, some locations such as Bangalore do not have WFH capabilities and may need to use tethering via mobile phones, procure extra equipment or make other arrangements determined by the BFT/CXC CPR team. If a Support Services site is unavailable for an extended period, the BFT will decide alternatives, such as temporarily working in another building or moving to a different site until the original site is accessible again. Your local CSC (Cisco Security Center) can be engaged to help allocate workspaces. The Site Director or Theater VP will communicate the instructions and timing of moving to a different building or site location once that location becomes available. Sydney for example can re-locate to Sydney Office Level-22 if needed. Bangalore for example can re-locate to BGL13 if needed. All other centers re-locations will be determined by BFT/CXC CPR/Site Directors.",

If resources are damaged (e.g. equipment, laptop), the manager closest to the information on what is needed will be tasked with replacement. For example, the site director may need to coordinate replacement of laptops, phones, etc. were affected by an event at a site. Most L1 TCE’s (GDP/Partner) do not have CVO (Cisco Virtual Office) or a company provided laptop. BFT/CXC CPR will contact the Support Services L1 Vendor Managers for options such as VPN. Support Services engineers can normally work from home by connecting to VPN (AnyConnect) or CVO (Cisco Virtual Office setup) to work service requests. However, working from home may not be feasible in all situations & if Support Services is unable to operate at normal productivity levels by working at home, then the BFT/CXC CPR may decide to offload Service Requests to other available teams/theaters. In that event, the BFT/CXC CPR will work with Routing Ops to change case routing to other theatres for technology queues, and in some situations, it may be necessary to assign existing Service Requests to those other Support Services sites. GDP/Partner Vendors, Managers and other necessary teams may be utilized as well. The Support Services Technology Team Manager (not the CPR/DM) continues to be responsible for assigning existing Service Requests to other Support Services sites. They will Identify dependencies on potential site, identify additional workload on potential site and help coordinate transition with appropriate teams and management. Additionally, some locations such as Bangalore do not have WFH capabilities and may need to use tethering via mobile phones, procure extra equipment or make other arrangements determined by the BFT/CXC CPR team. If a Support Services site is unavailable for an extended period, the BFT will decide alternatives, such as temporarily working in another building or moving to a different site until the original site is accessible again. Your local CSC (Cisco Security Center) can be engaged to help allocate workspaces. The Site Director or Theater VP will communicate the instructions and timing of moving to a different building or site location once that location becomes available. Sydney for example can re-locate to Sydney Office Level-22 if needed. Bangalore for example can re-locate to BGL13 if needed. All other centers re-locations will be determined by BFT/CXC CPR/Site Directors.",
                "If labs in the affected site are unusable, Support Services engineers in the affected location will need to remotely use the labs in other locations.
